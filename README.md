# LSTM-based Next Word Prediction
This project focuses on implementing a language model that can predict the next word in a given sentence using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, which is preprocessed to generate sequences of words. The LSTM network is then trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. The trained model can generate text, autocomplete sentences, and improve the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Getting Started
To start this project, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the next_word_prediction.ipynb file to train and test the LSTM-based language model on a text corpus.
